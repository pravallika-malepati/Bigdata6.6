                                        Assignment 6.6

1.Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler
A)
  Scheduler: Scheduler  schedules the allocation of resources to the applications Or jobs.
   FIFO Scheduler: 

       1.FIFO is First In First Out .
       2.A FIFO scheduler allocates resources to the applications or the jobs that come at first.
       3.Even though the next coming job is smaller than the 1st one, it has to wait until job1 is finished.Only then, resources are allocated to job2.
       4.job that submitted first is allocated resources and the job that submitted later is allocated the resouces later.
       5.Time of completion of all the jobs is more.
  
Capacity Scheduler:

     1.It allocates resources to applications based on the size of the job.
      2. efficiency is imcreased.
     3.Smaller job is allocated resources first and after its completion, resources are  then given to the next smaller job.
     4.Reduces the time of completion of jobs.

   
2)What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x
A)
   Limitations of hadoop 1.x:
       1.Single node failure.If the name node fails, the whole HDFS gets down.
       2.Suitable for a maximum of 4000 nodes and 40000 tasks.
       3.Supports only map reduce processing model.
       4.TaskTracker is configured with static slots.Map tasks cannot run on reduce slot
         So,cluster utilisation is low.
       
  Hadoop 2.x:
      1.Multiple namenodes are introduced inorder to overcome single node failure.
      2.Supports processing models other than map reducIt can scale upto 10000 nodes and 100000 tasks.
      3.Resources are dynamic and fine-grained.BEtter cluster utilisation.
      5.Overhead of work of namenode is reduced.
